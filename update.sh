Update the 'bottle' section in 'Formula/qt.rb' like so, but with the correct sha256sum (see above) and the correct version (again, see above)

  bottle do
    root_url "https://github.com/maxfierke/homebrew-qt/releases/download/vX.X.X_1"
    rebuild 1
    sha256 "2d54c0c0db8548e63134250950f9ac69d9ae52c101e397a1c1230d31bf3731ef" => :sierra
  end

Now commit the formula and push it to Github.
Then create a new release [1] with the correct name (so that the URL above becomes valid!).
Finally, upload the created tar.gz file to the release.
